Software engineering is a field awash with opinions, and it is easy to get swept
away with the tide in the absence of strong guiding principles to anchor
oneself. This document describes my approach to software engineering. It serves
as my anchor. It is colored by personal preferences and tempered by personal
experience. It covers both general principles as well as specific applications.
It is a living record and as such is bound to grow and mature as I do. It is
also hosted as a version-controlled repository, which means that you can see how
my thinking has changed over time, and how I reached this point.

It is meant primarily as a guiding force in my own practice, but if you find
yourself reading this (dear stranger), I encourage you to fork it, shape it to
your own needs, and draw value from it as well. If you think I should change my
approach to any or all of the subjects enumerated below, please make the case.
In mind, as in matter, pull requests are welcome.
